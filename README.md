Elder Safe Alert Logic â€“ AI & IoT Simulation Project


ðŸ“„ Project Overview

This project simulates environmental monitoring for elderly safety using IoT sensor data and AI-based logic.

The system analyzes temperature, humidity, and COâ‚‚ levels to determine safe, warning, and danger conditions.

It integrates both real and simulated data (SML2010 dataset + synthetic samples) to trigger alerts for unsafe conditions.



- Features
 
Hybrid dataset (real + synthetic) integration

Rule-based alert logic for environmental risk

Visualization of alert distribution by factor

Python-based processing compatible with Google Colab

Ready for extension with ML or cloud IoT platforms



- Requirements

Library	Version	Description

Python 3.10 +	â€“	Core runtime

pandas	â‰¥ 1.5	Data manipulation

matplotlib	â‰¥ 3.7	Graphs & charts

numpy	â‰¥ 1.24	Numerical operations

google.colab	â€“	Colab runtime support


Install with:

- Files

ElderSafeAlertLogic.ipynb â€“ main Colab notebook with code

NEW-DATA-1.T15.txt â€“ input dataset (upload before running notebook)



- How to Run (on Google Colab)
 
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab

2. Upload NEW-DATA-1.T15.txt to the Colab workspace
   
3. Run each cell sequentially from top to bottom
   
4. View generated plots and alert summaries at the end
   
Methodology

Input Data: Temperature, humidity, and COâ‚‚ from SML2010 dataset + simulated values

Processing: Apply rule-based alert logic using threshold ranges

Output: Summary table showing safe, warning, and danger percentages
